Well, unfortunately we have had to wait for one of the most relevant generational changes in the professional scene.\n\nDigital natives are beginning to reach management positions or start their own projects, determined to optimize time without giving up the best results and suddenly, in an environment where everything is within reach of a click, they find themselves obliged to have endless meetings and processes with technology consultancies to make certain decisions that end up arriving late, poorly contrasted by the client and absolutely not neutral among all existing options.\n\nUntil today."

            "content": "They are many things. They are friends, first of all. Friends with a shared ambition for many years: To be able to change the course of the sector with which they have always shared their professional career.\n\nIván is a sociologist specialized in human resources with experience in digital business development. His professional career is divided into two very marked parts: A first stage dedicated to IT personnel selection and a second very related to the start-up world.\n\nMarcos is a developer, a possibility he chose after finishing his computer engineering and business administration studies. His professional career has been very linked to the start-up environment. He is a person with interpersonal skills comparable to his development talent.\n\nOf course, I think anyone would say that they are not ordinary people and that, in most cases, they stand out for their way of interpreting reality. This time bomb couldn't leave anyone indifferent and well, nice to meet you all!"
